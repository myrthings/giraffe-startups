- **[A Quantitative Approach to Product-Market Fit](https://tribecap.co/a-quantitative-approach-to-product-market-fit/) by *Tribe Capital* (Jul, 2019)**

  This article is a must. Product-Market Fit is hard to measure. However, this approach is awesome to put some light on what is happening with your users and how they interact with your product. They build a multidimensional plot to understand what is happening inside but for me the greatest creation is the generalization of "Product-Market Fit unit".

  Yeah, Product-Market Fit is hard. This is a completely different approach that instead of user data, asks directly to the clients about how they feel about the product. Then NLP is used to improve the product focusing on fans' opinions.
